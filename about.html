                <h3>Hi</h3>
                <h1>I'm <span>KUMUDINI <br></span>a Frountend
                     developer</h1>
                     <p>I am a skilled frontend developer with a strong command of C++, HTML, and C language and  I am proficient in JavaScript and CSS. 
                       In my role as a frontend developer, I have worked on a diverse range of projects. I have developed responsive websites  
                       that prioritize user experience and accessibility.  I am experienced with Git and GitHub for version control and collaborative 
                       development, ensuring that projects are well-organized and efficiently managed.
                       Beyond development, I have a keen interest in video editing. My video editing skills include cutting and merging clips,
                       adding effects and transitions, color grading, and sound design. I enjoy bringing stories to life through creative and engaging video content. 
                        Whether it's for professional projects, social media, or personal
                       endeavors, I strive to produce high-quality videos that captivate audiences. I am also active on social media, 
                       leveraging platforms like LinkedIn to stay connected with the industry and share my professional insights and experiences.
                        </p>
